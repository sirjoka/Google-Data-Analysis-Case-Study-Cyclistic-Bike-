# This capstone project is for the Google Data Analytics course.

# =============================================

# BACKGROUND

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. 

As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, our team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, we are tasked to design a new marketing strategy the company will use to convert casual riders into annual members. We need a strategy is not only easy and cost effective to implement, but also a strategy that will get the approval of the executive team.

## Stakeholders:
1. The director of marketing, Lily Moreno.

2. Cyclistic marketing analytics team.

3. Cyclistic executive team.

# =============================================

# STEP 1: ASK?

Business Task:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?


# =============================================

# STEP 2: PREPARE DATA


For this project, I will use the public data of Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under the license.

The company has provided me with monthly data for the last 12 months, which I downloaded directly from their website.The data is assumed to be credible since it was compiled and published by the organisation internally.

The data is found to have consistent structure across all the 12 months, albeit with some data missing.The names of starting stations and ending stations for some months are missing, as the company wasn't collecting those data as of then. So we will rely on the coordinates for the starting staions and ending stations instead.


# =============================================

# STEP 3: PROCESS

I started the process of data cleaning and processing in Excel, where I calculated the ride time for each trip in the data provided.I also joined the start station latitude and longitude into one string named start station coordinate, as well as the end station latitude and longitude and named it end station coordinate.

Now using R, I will...

Create a single data-frame by joining all the files (12) into a single file

Check list of column names and number of columns

Inspect Data by checking for consistency in each data column

Join individual data frames into one single data frame

Check list of column names and number of columns

Inspect Data by checking for consistency in each data column

Clean data and get it ready for analysis


# =============================================

# STEP 4: ANALYZE DATA BY RUNNING ANALYTICAL QUERIES

Run exploratory analysis to find trends, patterns and insights to understand data more.

# =============================================

# STEP 5: SHARE INSIGTHS AND VISUALS TO HIGLIGHT TRENDS AND RELATIONSHIPS

Visualize data to easily identify trends and relationships
